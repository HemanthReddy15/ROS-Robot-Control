# ROS Robot Control

This Python script represents a comprehensive robot control system featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with custom Tkinter. The system seamlessly incorporates a range of functionalities for precise robot control, encompassing motor movements, servo manipulation, camera surveillance, temperature sensing, and additional capabilities.




## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.12.X
- pip
- [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) (recommended)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HemanthReddy15/ROS-Robot-Control.git
```
2. Change the project directory
```bash
  cd ROS-Robot-Control

```
3. Install the dependencies 
```bash
  pip install Pillow customtkinter==0.3 opencv-python pyfirmata2

```
